# Monovi Incudemy Register Page
## Incudemy Training Site Front-End and Back-End Software Development
It is the user registration page of a Incudemy training site that I started and developed during my internship at Monovi Information Technologies.
I stored user information using MSSQL and MySQL technologies and I pulled information such as university, department, class from the database.
I created the interface of the user registration page using Asp.Net MVC and C# technology, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRÄ°PT information.

This training site includes;
* You can register on this site as an Instructor (Teacher) or a Incudemist (Student), receive training or give training.
* Users registered as Instructors (Teachers) will be able to open tutorials, create surveys, take quizzes and issue certificates to incudemists.
* The Incudemist (Student), on the other hand, will be able to receive training, participate in exams and surveys, send feedback and obtain a certificate if requested.
