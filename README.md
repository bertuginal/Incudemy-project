# Incudemy Project
## Incudemy Training Site Front-End and Back-End Software Development
* The Incudemy project is an educational website that I started and developed during my internship at Monovi Information Technologies.
* You can register on this site as an Instructor or a student (Incudemist), receive training or give training.
* Users registered as Instructors will be able to open tutorials, create surveys and do quizzes. Incudemist, on the other hand, will be able to receive these trainings, participate in exams and surveys, and send feedback if desired.
